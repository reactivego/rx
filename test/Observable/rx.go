// Observer is a function that gets called whenever the Observable has
// something to report. The next argument is the item value that is only
// valid when the done argument is false. When done is true and the err
// argument is not nil, then the Observable has terminated with an error.
// When done is true and the err argument is nil, then the Observable has
// completed normally.

// Subscriber is an interface that can be passed in when subscribing to an
// Observable. It allows a set of observable subscriptions to be canceled
// from a single subscriber at the root of the subscription tree.

//jig:name Observable

// Observable is a function taking an Observer, Scheduler and Subscriber.
// Calling it will subscribe the Observer to events from the Observable.
