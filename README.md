[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/reactivego/rx.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx)

Package `rx` provides _**R**eactive E**x**tensions_, a powerful API for asynchronous programming in Go, built around [observables](#observables) and [operators](#operators) to process streams of data seamlessly.

## Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need [*Go 1.23*](https://golang.org/dl/) or later, as the implementation depends on language support for generics and iterators.

## Observables

In `rx`, an [**Observables**](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html) represents a stream of data that can emit items over time, while an **Observer** subscribes to it to receive and react to those emissions. This reactive approach enables asynchronous and concurrent operations without blocking execution. Instead of waiting for values to become available, an observer passively listens and responds whenever the observable emits data, errors, or a completion signal.

This page introduces the **reactive pattern**, explaining what **Observables** and **Observers** are and how subscriptions work. Other sections explore the powerful set of [**Operators**](https://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html) that allow you to transform, combine, and control data streams efficiently.

An Observable:

- is a stream of events.
- assumes zero to many values over time.
- pushes values
- can take any amount of time to complete (or may never)
- is cancellable
- is lazy (it doesn't do anything until you subscribe).

Example
```go
package main

import "github.com/reactivego/x"

func main() {
    x.From[any](1,"hi",2.3).Println().Wait()
}
```
> Note the program creates a mixed type `any` observable from an int, string and a float64.

Output
```
1
hi
2.3
```
Example
```go
package main

import "github.com/reactivego/rx"

func main() {
    rx.From(1,2,3).Println().Wait()
}
```
> Note the program uses inferred type `int` for the observable.

Output
```
1
2
3
```

Observables in `rx` offer several advantages over standard Go channels:

### Hot vs Cold Observables

- **Hot Observables** emit values regardless of subscription status. Like a live broadcast, any values emitted when no subscribers are listening are permanently missed. Examples include system events, mouse movements, or real-time data feeds.

- **Cold Observables** begin emission only when subscribed to, ensuring subscribers receive the complete data sequence from the beginning. Examples include file contents, database queries, or HTTP requests that are executed on-demand.

### Rich Lifecycle Management

Observables offer comprehensive lifecycle handling. They can complete normally, terminate with errors, or continue indefinitely. Subscriptions provide fine-grained control, allowing subscribers to cancel at any point, preventing resource leaks and unwanted processing.

### Time-Varying Data Model

Unlike traditional variables that represent static values, Observables elegantly model how values evolve over time. They represent the entire progression of a value's state changes, not just its current state, making them ideal for reactive programming paradigms.

### Native Concurrency Support

Concurrency is built into the Observable paradigm. Each Observable conceptually operates as an independent process that asynchronously pushes values to subscribers. This approach naturally aligns with concurrent programming models while abstracting away much of the complexity typically associated with managing concurrent operations.

## Operators

Operators form a language for expressing programs with Observables. They transform, filter, and combine one or more Observables into new Observables, allowing for powerful data stream processing. Each operator performs a specific function in the reactive pipeline, enabling you to compose complex asynchronous workflows through method chaining.

### Index

[__All__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#Observable.All) converts an Observable stream into a Go 1.22+ iterator sequence that provides each emitted value paired with its sequential zero-based index

[__All2__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#All2)
converts an Observable of Tuple2 pairs into a Go 1.22+ iterator sequence that yields each tuple's components (First, Second) as separate values.

[__Append__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#Append)
creates a pipe that appends emitted values to a provided slice while forwarding them to the next observer, with a method variant available for chaining.

[__AsObservable__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#AsObservable)
provides type conversion between observables, allowing you to safely cast an Observable of one type to another, and to convert a typed Observable to an Observable of 'any' type (and vice versa).

[__AsObserver__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#AsObserver) converts an Observer of type `any` to an Observer of a specific type T.

[__Assign__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#Observable.Assign) stores each emitted value from an Observable into a provided pointer variable while passing all emissions through to the next observer, enabling value capture during stream processing.

[__AutoConnect__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#Connectable.AutoConnect) makes a (Connectable) Multicaster behave like an ordinary Observable that automatically connects the mullticaster to its source when the specified number of observers have subscribed to it.

[__AutoUnsubscribe__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#Observable.AutoUnsubscribe)

[__BufferCount__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#BufferCount)

[__Catch__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#Observable.Catch) recovers from an error notification by continuing the sequence without emitting the error but switching to the catch ObservableInt to provide items.

[__CatchError__](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx#Observable.CatchError)  catches errors on the Observable to be handled by returning a new Observable or throwing error.

__CombineAll__

__CombineLatest__ combines multiple Observables into one by emitting an array containing the latest values from each source whenever any input Observable emits a value, with variants (__CombineLatest2__, __CombineLatest3__, __CombineLatest4__, __CombineLatest5__) that return strongly-typed tuples for 2-5 input Observables respectively.

__Concat__ combines multiple Observables sequentially by emitting all values from the first Observable before proceeding to the next one, ensuring emissions never overlap.

__ConcatAll__ transforms a higher-order Observable (an Observable that emits other Observables) into a first-order Observable by subscribing to each inner Observable only after the previous one completes.

__ConcatMap__ projects each source value to an Observable, subscribes to it, and emits its values, waiting for each one to complete before processing the next source value.

__ConcatWith__ extends an Observable by appending additional Observables, ensuring that emissions from each Observable only begin after the previous one completes.

__Connectable__ is an Observable with delayed connection to its source, combining both Observable and Connector interfaces. It separates the subscription process into two parts: observers can register via Subscribe, but the Observable won't subscribe to its source until Connect is explicitly called. This enables multiple observers to subscribe before any emissions begin (multicast behavior), allowing a single source Observable to be efficiently shared among multiple consumers. Besides inheriting all methods from Observable and Connector, Connectable provides the convenience methods __AutoConnect__ and __RefCount__ to manage connection behavior.

__Connect__ establishes a connection to the source Observable and returns a Subscription that can be used to cancel the connection when no longer needed.

__Connector__ provides a mechanism for controlling when a Connectable Observable subscribes to its source, allowing you to connect the Observable independently from when observers subscribe to it. This separation enables multiple subscribers to prepare their subscriptions before the source begins emitting items. It has a single method __Connect__.

__Constraints__ type constraints __Signed__, __Unsigned__, __Integer__ and __Float__ copied verbatim from `golang.org/x/exp` so we could drop the dependency on that package.

__Count__ returns an Observable that emits a single value representing the total number of items emitted by the source Observable before it completes.

__Create__ constructs a new Observable from a Creator function, providing a bridge between imperative code and the reactive Observable pattern. The Observable will continue producing values until the Creator signals completion, the Observer unsubscribes, or the Creator returns an error.

__Creator__ is a function type that generates values for an Observable stream. It receives a zero-based index for the current iteration and returns a tuple containing the next value to emit, any error that occurred, and a boolean flag indicating whether the sequence is complete.

__Defer__

__Delay__

__DistinctUntilChanged__ only emits when the current value is different from the last.
