[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/reactivego/rx.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/reactivego/rx)

Package `rx` delivers _**R**eactive E**x**tensions_, a powerful API for asynchronous programming in Go, built around [observables](#observables) and [operators](#operators) to handle data streams seamlessly.
## Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need [*Go 1.23*](https://golang.org/dl/) or later, as it includes support for generics and iterators.

## Observables
In `rx`, an [**Observables**](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html) represents a stream of data that can emit items over time, while an **observer** subscribes to it to receive and react to those emissions. This reactive approach enables asynchronous and concurrent operations without blocking execution. Instead of waiting for values to become available, an observer passively listens and responds whenever the Observable emits data, errors, or a completion signal.

This page introduces the **reactive pattern**, explaining what **Observables** and **observers** are and how subscriptions work. Other sections explore the powerful set of **Observable operators** that allow you to transform, combine, and control data streams efficiently.

An Observable:

- is a stream of events.
- assumes zero to many values over time.
- pushes values
- can take any amount of time to complete (or may never)
- is cancellable
- is lazy (it doesn't do anything until you subscribe).

Example
```go
package main

import "github.com/reactivego/x"

func main() {
    x.From[any](1,"hi",2.3).Println()
}
```
> Note the program creates a mixed type `any` observable from an int, string and a float64.

Output
```
1
hi
2.3
```
Example
```go
package main

import "github.com/reactivego/rx"

func main() {
    rx.From(1,2,3).Println()
}
```
> Note the program uses inferred type `int` for the observable.

Output
```
1
2
3
```

Observables in `x` are somewhat similar to Go channels but have much richer
semantics:

Observables can be hot or cold. A hot observable will try to emit values even
when nobody is subscribed. Values emitted during that period will be lost.
The position of a mouse pointer or the current time are examples of hot observables.

A cold observable will only start emitting values after somebody subscribes.
The contents of a file or a database are examples of cold observables.

An observable can complete normally or with an error, it uses subscriptions
that can be canceled from the subscriber side. Where a normal variable is
just a place where you read and write values from, an observable captures how
the value of this variable changes over time.

Concurrency flows naturally from the fact that an observable is an ever
changing stream of values. Every Observable conceptually has at its core a
concurrently running process that pushes out values.

## Operators
Operators form a language in which programs featuring Observables can be expressed.
They work on one or more Observables to transform, filter and combine them into new Observables.
